## **1. Summary**

This document describes the izzbie.io SDK used on the Android platform when third-party vendors integrate virtual networks. Its purpose is to allow third-party developers’ developers to quickly embed virtual network functions into third-party applications.

This document is suitable for the company's internal and third-party R&D personnel who have signed the NDA to read.

## **2. System Requirements**

The target system to run requires Android 5.0 or higher, and Android 4.4 and lower systems do not provide technical support.

## **3. Quick Access**
## **Step 1: Get AppID**

Please contact izzbie.io Inc. to apply for SDK authorization information. After the application is successful, we will provide a unique identifier for accessing the platform, including AppID, PartnerId and DeviceClassNum, and provide the corresponding SDK text (cmapi_ShieldAPI_vX_X_X_cmg.aar) and Demo project.

## **Step 2: Configure the application**

## **Configuration environment**

### **Import izzbie SDK**

1. Put the cmapi_ShieldAPI_vX_X_X_cmg.aar package in the libs directory of your application project (the file name in the picture is only an example, please refer to the actual SDK file name):

![图片](https://github.com/nfc-apps/izzbie-android/blob/main/img/image%20(1).png)

2. In the build.gradle of the main project, add the following content and use the libs directory as a dependency repository:

![图片](https://github.com/nfc-apps/izzbie-android/blob/main/img/image%20(2).png)

```plain
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // Add the following content
        flatDir {
            dirs 'libs'
        }
        // ... jcenter() 
    }
}
```
3. In the build.gradle of your App Module, add the following content to make the izzbie SDK a project dependency:

![图片](https://github.com/nfc-apps/izzbie-android/blob/main/img/image%20(3).png)

```plain
dependencies {
    // Add the following content
    implementation files('libs/cmapi_ShieldAPI_v3.0.2701.aar')
    ....
}
```
Finally, synchronize the configuration file Sync project with Gradle Files:
![图片](https://github.com/nfc-apps/izzbie-android/blob/main/img/image%20(4).jpeg)

So far, the import of We line SDK development resources is complete.


### **Register AppId**

Before calling the API in the SDK, you need to register your AppId with the platform in your Application. The code is as follows:

```plain
public class App extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        //Register the app to the platform
        CMAPI.getInstance().init(this, "Your appId", "Your partnerId", Your devicesClassNum);
        ....
    }
}
```
### **Configure PAC domain name parameters [optional]**

If you need to use the node DNS to resolve a specific domain name, you can configure the PAC parameters, and the configured domain name can be multiple.

★ Configuration rules:'?' means an arbitrary character,'*' means zero or more arbitrary characters, such as *.cmhk.com, means that the domain name ending with .cmhk.com is resolved by node DNS.

The configuration code is as follows:

```plain
public class App extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        //Register the app to the platform
        CMAPI.getInstance().registerApp(this, "Your appId", "Your partnerId", Your devicesClassNum);
        //Configure PAC domain name filtering, such as *.cmhk.com
        CMAPI.getInstance().setPacOptionEnable(new String[]{"xxx.xxx.xxx"});
        ....
    }
}
```
Regarding the detailed configuration of PAC, you can check relevant information online.

### **Configure login authentication server**

Before calling the login API, please configure your login authentication server address, the configuration code is as follows:

```plain
public class LoginActivity extends Activity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        //Configure the login authentication server address, such as net.cmhk.com
        CMAPI.getInstance().setLoginAsHost("xxx.xxx.xxx");
    }
}
```
## **Step 3: Log in**

### **Log in**

★ Note: The Mobile Shield SDK does not currently support user registration. All account information that can be logged in to the system is provided by a third-party manufacturer to connect to the izzbie.io back-end system.

You can call the CMAPI.getInstance().login() method to log in with the user name and password according to the user name and password entered by the user.

```plain
public class LoginActivity extends Activity {
    ...
    public void login(View view){
        //The user clicked the login button
        if(view.getId() == R.id.btnLogin){
            //Get the mobile phone number entered by the user
            String account = etAccount.getText().toString();
            //Get the password entered by the user
            String password = etPassword.getText().toString();
            //Call platform login API
           CMAPI.getInstance().login(account, password, new ResultListener(){
                @Override
                public void onError(int errorCode) {
                    if(errorCode == Constants.DR_INVALID_PASS||errorCode == Constants.DR_INVALID_USER) {
                        Toast.makeText(this, "wrong user name or password", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                    }else if(errorCode == Constants.DR_VPN_TUNNEL_IS_OCCUPIED){
                        Toast.makeText(this, "VPN tunnel is occupied", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                    }
                }
            });
        }
    }
```
To log in to the SDK for the first time, you need to request the permission of VPNService. After calling the login interface, the system authorization window will pop up.
### **Automatic log-in**

The logged-in user, in order to facilitate the user to enter the APP next time without having to log in repeatedly, the API can be called

CMAPI.getInstance().loginByTicket method for automatic login:

```plain
CMAPI.getInstance().loginByTicket(lastLoginedAccount, new ResultListener() {
                    @Override
                    public void onError(int errorCode) {
                        if (errorCode == Constants.DR_VPN_TUNNEL_IS_OCCUPIED) {
                            Toast.makeText(this, "VPN tunnel is occupied", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                        }
                   ...//Other error code handling
                    }
                });
```
For the definition of errorCode, please refer to －【Error Code】
★ Note: Once the user logs in successfully, the mobile shield underlying system will retain the current user login information, and the client can call the API to automatically log in. The saved login information is time-sensitive and will automatically become invalid after a certain period of time.

Before calling the login interface, you must ensure that the current state is disconnected.

### **Cancel the login process**

After the login() call is successful, before the status changes to CONNECTED, cancelLogin can be called to terminate the login process.

CMAPI.getInstance().cancelLogin()

## **Step 4: Monitor the login status**

★ Note: Calling the login interface is an asynchronous request. To determine whether the login is successful, you need to call back based on the listener. ConnectionStatusListener calls back the onEstablished() method, indicating that the login is successful.

### **Add listener**

We must add a login listener to monitor the callback of the login state, and perform event processing or page update according to different states.

Create the listener code as follows:

```plain
public class LoginActivity extends Activity {
    //Create a login status listener
    private ConnectStatusListenerPlus listener = new ConnectStatusListenerPlus() {
        @Override
        public void onConnecting() {//logging in
            //Show loading progress bar
            showLoadingProgress("logging in...");
        }
        ...//Other status
        @Override
        public void onEstablished() {//login successful
            //Close loading progress bar
            dissmissLoadingProgress();
            //Such as login page, jump to the homepage
            startActivity(new Intent(LoginActivity.this, MainActivity.class));
            finish();
        }
    };
    .....
```
For details about the login callback method, please refer to －【Login callback process】
For monitoring in Activity (such as LoginActivity), it is recommended to add a listener in the onStart method:

```plain
@Override
protected void onStart() {
    super.onStart();
    //Add listener
    CMAPI.getInstance().addConnectionStatusListener(listener);
}
```
And remove the listener in the onStop method:

```plain
@Override
protected void onStop() {
    super.onStop();
    //remove listener    CMAPI.getInstance().removeConnectionStatusListener(listener);
}
```
Of course, you can also monitor in other places, such as Fragment or Application, which can be added to any place you need to monitor. And when you do not need to monitor (such as the life cycle is completed), remove the listener.
★ Note: The login status will change at any time due to network conditions. For example, when the network is disconnected, the connection will be disconnected when logged in, and the system will automatically try to reconnect and call back the onConnecting() method until the network is restored again and the connection is successful Call back the onEstablished() method.

### **Login callback process**

![图片](https://github.com/nfc-apps/izzbie-android/blob/main/img/image%20(6).png)

### **Login status value**

★ Note: You can monitor the login status in real time by adding a listener, or you can use the following code to get the latest status of the current login connection:

int status = CMAPI.getInstance().getRealtimeInfo().getCurrentStatus();

Note: CMAPI.getInstance().getRealtimeInfo() may be null.

The definition of each status value is as follows:

|State name (constant in Constants)|Status value|Description|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|CS_UNKNOWN|0|Uninitialized|
|CS_PREPARE|1|Ready|
|CS_CONNECTING|2|Connecting|
|CS_CONNECTED|3|Successfully connected|
|CS_DISCONNECTED|4|Disconnected|
|CS_AUTHENTICATED|5|Successfully authenticated|
|CS_DISCONNECTING|8|Disconnecting|
|CS_ESTABLISHED|200|The virtual network connection is successful, and the login is successful|

## **Step 5: Log out**

After calling the logout API, the logged out user will no longer save the login ticket and cannot automatically log in.

```plain
public class SettingActivity extends Activity {
    @Override
    protected void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
        //Add login status listener
        CMAPI.getInstance().addConnectionStatusListener(statusListener);
        ...
    }
    public void loginOut(View view){//Logout
        //The user clicked the logout button
        if(view.getId() == R.id.btnLoginOut){
            //Call the logout API
            CMAPI.getInstance().disconnect();
            //Remove account information
            CMAPI.getInstance().removeUser(CMAPI.getInstance().getBaseInfo().getUserId());
            if(networkNotAvailable){
              //When there is no network (cannot connect to the external network), it will automatically disconnect without waiting for the callback
              //Never reconnect
              CMAPI.getInstance().cancelLogin();
                //Log out successfully, jump to the login page
              startActivity(new
              Intent(SettingActivity.this,LoginActivity.class));
              finish()
            }
        }
    }
    protected ConnectStatusListenerPlus statusListener = new ConnectStatusListenerPlus() {
        @Override
        public void onDisconnected(int reason) {
            //Log out successfully, jump to the login page
            startActivity(new Intent(SettingActivity.this,LoginActivity.class));
            finish();
        }
    };
    @Override
    protected void onStop() {
        super.onStop();
        //Remove status listener
        CMAPI.getInstance().removeConnectionStatusListener(statusListener);
    }
    ...
```
## **Other event monitoring**

If you need to monitor the occupancy status of the VPN tunnel, real-time online duration or delay, etc., you can monitor it through the CMAPI.getInstance().subscribe method.

For details on other event monitoring, please refer to [Related API-EventObserver].

```plain
CMAPI.getInstance().subscribe(observer);
private EventObserver observer = new EventObserver() {
    @Override
    public void onRealTimeInfoChanged(RealtimeInfo info) {
        //Real-time information changes, this method calls back once per second after subscribing to refresh real-time information such as online duration and delay
    }
    @Override
    public void onTunnelRevoke(boolean isRevoked) {
        // isRevoked: Whether the VPN tunnel is occupied, call back this method only when its value changes
    }
};
```
Remove event listener:
```plain
CMAPI.getInstance().unsubscribe(observer);
```

## **6. FAQ**
* **Cannot log in, prompt 2018——VPN permission denied**
1. Please note that the izzbie.io service is built on the basis of a VPN. To use the izzbie.io service, please authorize the VPN for the application first. When the login is called for the first time, a system permission inquiry window will pop up. If you refuse, you need to enter the system setting interface to set it.

2.VThe VPN tunnel is occupied by other applications. Please close other VPN applications and try to log in again. If the channel is preempted by other VPN applications after logging in, the SDK will automatically reconnect after closing other VPN applications.

* **About network switching and disconnected reconnection**

The VPN connection status maintained by the SDK will automatically reconnect when disconnected. Common abnormal disconnections are as follows:

1. Network fluctuations

2. Switched the currently used network, such as changing WIFI, switching between 4G and WIFI

3. The VPN tunnel is occupied (in order to avoid continuous competition for the tunnel, the connection will be reconnected when the tunnel is not occupied)

When automatically reconnecting, the status event listener will call back onConnecting(), and the logic of waiting for the animation can be written in the callback

* **The connection is interrupted when running in the background**

Some Android systems (EMUI) do not support long-term background operation by default, and need to manually set the self-start permission. In addition, some Android systems (MIUI) run normally in the background, but cannot automatically reconnect after the connection is interrupted. You need to manually set the power saving policy to no longer restrict this application.

Some systems can use the following methods to open the current application settings to modify self-starting permissions and power saving strategies. It is recommended to use pop-up prompts to guide users to click to jump:

```plain
Intent intent = new Intent();
intent.setAction(Settings.ACTION_APPLICATION_DETAILS_SETTINGS);
Uri uri = Uri.fromParts("package", getActivity().getPackageName(), null);
intent.setData(uri);
startActivity(intent);
```
